# markov_text_generator

Takes a text file and generates a term-frequency matrix in order to find which terms typically follow the preceding word.<br>
Duplicates are preserved in order to give these terms a better chance of being selected.<br>
This is then used to generate new sentences in a similar style of the original text.
